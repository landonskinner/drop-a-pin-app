## DropAPin
This application was built using a React frontend and a Ruby on Rails backend. The DropAPin travel blog application is designed for users to share their experiences travelling around the world. Following user authentication through login or signup, the 'Feed' tab is populated with posts made by all users. Users can show their support or ask any burning questions by commenting on another's post. From the 'Account' tab, the user has full CRUD abilities with their own blog posts. If a user is looking to learn more about a specific location, the 'Search' tab allows for the filtering of posts by location.
